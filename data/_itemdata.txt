Miko Board
When used, it increase a character's equipment mass by 1. It takes 50
to get one character's equipment mass to max. Don't even try to imagine
the time it'll take to max it out for your entire party.
Maximum TP +3

Tin Watering Can
Given to a collapsed traveller who requested water, in that rather famous
prologue scene. Today's farmer life consists of methodically growing
turnips over and over again with this as well.
Maximum TP +5

Grand Dragon Medal
The mark of a hardcore gamer who collected all bronze and silver monster
medals. With all those battles, the party would surely be really strong,
but it's still disappointing that he wasn't much harder than divine dragon.
Maximum TP +7

Tokyo Metronome
A valuable unique equip that halves environmental damage per turn.
After mid-game, the aim is to kill all enemies each turn, so the majority
of damage received will come from the wind, making this item invaluable.
Maximum TP +9

Cypress Stick
A cypress rod that isn't very thick. It's not very reliable as a blunt
weapon, but having a weapon at all gives people courage and a way to
fight back against those trying to intimidate them. Probably.
Maximum MP +3

Source of Magic
An offering from humans that increases the master's MaxMP by 1. Magic
that expends MP are strong, but for a mage his MaxMP is limitingly small.
People who are familiar with the game do just fine without magic anyway.
Maximum MP +4

Purple Orb
It might be the item you get from doing this or that in Zipangu,
or it might be the item that increases Max D.T. gauge for halflings.
It's an ambiguous item like that.
Maximum MP +6

Master's Emblem
Collect 8 of these to obtain the "Magic Bell" that gives unlimited MP. In
the previous work, differently translated, it only increased MP by 1.
Thus, a true god like the predecessor is in a different class... maybe.
Maximum MP +8

Eyetrack Orbitars
Slightly slow, but it has good homing and can charge up for a double shot.
The bullets stay upon hit, hitting multiple times. Annoying when used with
the power of Slip Shot. Lack of power and evasion skills are its weakness.
ACC +25

Frozen Eyes
Human technology designed to counteract JAM's EM and Optical techniques.
An "eye" that determines position by observing air flow caused by moving
objects. It completely nullifies any optical camouflages.
ACC +50

Long Fall Boots
Boots that prevent Portal Devices from breaking during long falls. With
this and the Portal Device, anyone could clear the test, one might think.
But seeing 2's Boots PV still reaffirms the protag's athletic ability.
EVA +20

Reflex Booster Augment
An augment pack that increases reflexes via implanting mechanical nerves.
Mechanical augmentation pushes the limits of the human body, but it also
brings discrimination issues between the augmented and the unaugmented.
EVA +40

Manga Meat
Its meat you often find in gag manga. No further explanation necessary.
It's not soft, but it stretches out a lot when you bite into it.
 
HP Recovery Rate +3

Recovery Armband
Increases HP recovery speed, but also causes hunger 6 times faster. With
the change in HP recovery speed, it's a necessary item for damage
races against endgame foes. You need wall-walking, stealth or this.
HP Recovery Rate +4

Life Drain Tome
A dark magic tome. The caster using it absorbs half the damage dealt. It
was always a mainstay for 1vMany situations, but having Armsthrift
and it being buyable made it even more broken. A must-have for Lunatic.
HP Recovery Rate +6

Elixir of Mages
An elixir that, when used, increases maximum MP. It's annoying to use
them one by one so people like to just drink them all right before the
last boss, but even that gets too annoying after enough replays.
MP Recovery Rate +1

Orb of Gaia
A divine orb guarded by a dragon. To get it, you need the Neutral Crystal
and multiple parties, so it's quite annoying.
 
MP Recovery Rate +2

Midgard's Tooth
A sword obtained from defeating a mystery heart in the Star Curtain. It's
the only quality B-rank equip, but not really that good when you get it.
 
Adds PSN effect to all attacks

Modified Taser
A dangerous stun gun held by a certain sister. It's made by
Yakuza, which guarantees its power. Without this, "that event" in
a certain chapter might not have happened.
Adds PAR effect to all attacks

Repulsion Orb
A red orb that's about the size of a volleyball. Allows its user to repel
anything he wishes. According to Rinnosuke's abilities, it can also
attract things, but no one knows how to use it that way.
Adds HVY effect to all attacks

Great Hammer
An item that can break statues blocking roads in the depth of Internet.
Obtainable in postgame, but you have to do a bunch of backtracking
and defeat a strong boss to get past a cube. Rather annoying to get.
Adds SHK effect to all attacks

Strange Meat Pie
From a world in ruins, befriending this heartwarming and closely-knit
family engaging in perfectly healthy activities and business gets you
this pie. In my opinion, it was the scariest part of the whole game.
Adds TRR effect to all attacks

Sword of Singing Delusion
A weapon that has a chance to inflict "Delusion" status when attacking.
It has a really awesome name.

Adds SIL effect to all attacks

Dark Will
Activates when the user wants something badly and it won't stop at murder
to get it. Eventually manifests itself into the stand piercing through
dimensions to get at the enemy. Pretty broken for a main character.
Adds DTH effect to all attacks

Violent Green Rupee
A sentient gem on the back of a certain younger sister.
Wearing it will probably increase your money luck.

Money Acquisition Rate +4%

Shoes of Happiness
Boots that give 1 EXP per step. It should be useful, but by the time you
get it, 1 EXP is a rounding error. By 8 onwards, it's generally used as
a material for Happy Hat instead. Poor thing.
EXP Acquisition Rate +6%

Growth Egg
A famous experience boosting accessory. Realize that Columbus was wrong
to find where its hidden. In 6 and Type-0 it's easy to get at a good time,
but otherwise, by the time it's gotten, it's not really useful any more.
EXP Acquisition Rate +10%

Pure Sake - Wild Boar
Sake that's made with only quality materials,
and hand-crafted with much care and effort.
Guaranteed to smell and taste good.
Maximum MP +2 Maximum TP +2

HQ Sake - Deer
Higher quality sake hand-crafted with even more care and effort.
The best that can be obtained within the Human Village.
 
Maximum MP +3 Maximum TP +3

Pure HQ Sake - Butterfly
Pure and top quality sake that holds prestige even amongst Gensokyo's
most powerful entities. It has a distinctive fruity smell that rivals
that of fruit wines. Many people use wineglasses when drinking it.
Maximum MP +4 Maximum TP +4

First Aid Kit
Restores 80% of damage sustained. On the highest difficulty, with zombies
faster than humans, taking 5 hits to kill and coming in mobs, any mistake
uses these up. Once your team's out of these, the real fight begins.
HP Recovery Rate -8 HP Base Value +4.8

Exorcising Staff
A miraculous staff that protects a certain fortress city from any and all
evil. It protects against external threats, but not internal threats. If
it's cursed, then it will be quickly retrieved, so don't worry about that.
MP Recovery Rate -2 Maximum MP +16

Chario Boots
Footwear that can be found in the Time Dungeon. It's common to loiter
around on your first time, and end up getting accosted by secret bosses.
 
SPD Base Value +0.8 ATK Base Value -1.2 MAG Base Value -1.2

Choice Scarf
An item that increases speed by 50%, but locks the user into one move.
It can be limiting once discovered, but even so it's still very powerful.
Useful on your aces, or on slow attackers.
SPD Base Value +1.0 Maximum MP -5 Maximum TP -5

Youkai Medal Shattering Axe
An item important to the story setting, this axe can shatter
Medals, and even occasionally, shatter the terrifying Youkai Medals.
He's also plenty strong without it, and when berserk, victory is 100%.
Maximum MP -5 ATK Base Value +1.0 MAG Base Value +1.0

Jogurt Doll
Number 1.
 
 
Maximum TP -8 Maximum MP +5 MP Recovery Rate +1

Primal Armor
A barrier that is created via sustained flow of certain particles. Its
defensive ability is excellent, and can stop most attacks from ACs. It's
was shocking to see the previous works' protagonist ACs become so useless.
Maximum MP -6 DEF Base Value +1.0 MND Base Value +1.0

Experimental MIRV
A weapon that fires 8 mini-nukes once. Makes one wonder what the heck the
inventor was thinking. The ammo is expensive, its over-elaborate effects
slows down the game, it's suicide when indoors... "Amazing" in many ways.
ACC -25 ATK Base Value +1.5 MAG Base Value +1.5

Micron's Magic Book
When used on field, it has a shrinking effect that unlocks new areas. In
battle, it turns you invincible, while reducing damage to 1, like a cheat.
The shortcuts were obvious, so that may well have been its true purpose.
EVA +48 DEF Base Value -2.0 MND Base Value-2.0

Ribbon
It's a ribbon, so obviously it increase all status ailment resistances.
There's no room for arguments.
 
All Resistances +50

Krosis
The mask worn by a Dragon Priest near a certain dragon lair. Many have felt the
despair from finishing a rough battle against a dragon, then being ambushed
by a Dragon Priest right after. Raises Smithing and Alchemy considerably.
Maximum MP +10

Button of Undying
A button given to you by someone as he unleashed his full power, having
finally finished recharging it with his strength. ...But only Rouga can
equip it, and you get it past the point where you can equip items. Strange.
Maximum MP +12 MP Recovery Rate +1

Judas Pain
A key to the gates of Hell broken into 8 pieces. Supposed to be held by the
the 7 Kings of Hell and DS, but now they're all within DS's body, with one
exception. Brings great power, but great pain to the mind, body, and soul.
Maximum MP +15 MP Recovery Rate +1

Ethos of Bodybuilding 1
Ethos #1: no one should stand out from the protagonist, apparently. A book
that extols the virtues of training your body to firm your mind. Cringey.
 
Maximum TP +12

Ethos of Bodybuilding 2
Ethos #2: A man never loses a 1v1 duel, apparently. A book that extols the
virtues of training your body to help others. Still kind of cringey.
 
Maximum TP +15 HP Recovery Rate +3

Ethos of Bodybuilding EX
Ethos #3: Sub-characters exist only to support the main characters from the
shadows, apparently. A book that extols the virtues of training so hard,
you overcome your role and become a main character. Cringey as always.
Maximum TP +20 HP Recovery Rate +6

Luck and Pluck
The sword bequeathed by an ancient honorable hero in his dying moments.
The sword originally had the word "LUCK" engraved into it, but the hero
used his blood to add the P to turn it into "PLUCK."
ATK Base Value +1.0 Drop Rate +20% when holder defeats an enemy

Marquis de Sade's Joy
One of the weapons used by vampires. A relatively normal knife compared to
the other weapons. Most fights are won with this up close, or Caligula from
afar. Used often in the story for angsty half-vampiric wrist-slitting.
Increases ailment effects on enemies by 15%

Egg
The final Quell created by an once-prosperous ancient civilization.
Contains the consciousness of the ancestors. Grants huge amounts of power,
but turns its owner into a human-antagonistic puppet of the ancestors.
All Stats Base Values +0.5 Occasionally heals ailments

Exalted Falchion
An unsealed sword with its true power unleashed. Deals effective damage to
dragons and fell dragons. You'll get owned by roided grunts at Lunatic's
last boss if you don't kill it quickly with this and the Parallel version.
Increases damage by 20% when hitting weaknesses

La Pucelle d'Orleans
One of the Five Heavenly Swords. Boasts great stats, but has a mind of its
own. Anyone who it doesn't acknowledge as legitimate will be damaged
when swinging it. However, just equipping it for the stats seems to be fine.
ATK Base Value +1.5 DEF Base Value +1.0 SPD Base Value +0.5

Force Booster
A very strong accessory that doubles the INT of its wearer. Turns anyone's
magic genocidal, but given the stat inflation that endgame enemies undergo,
this firepower-enhancing equipment actually ends up pretty balanced.
MAG Base Value +1.5, MND Base Value +1.0, SPD Base Value +0.5

Life Aura
A defensive barrier that negates attacks doing less than a set amount of
damage. Lasts a few turns except for enemies, where it even regenerates.
Negating 200+ damage in a game where the last boss has 2,000 HP is crazy.
Reduces damage taken by 8% of max HP, occasionally negates damage

Super Drill
A powerful and unique equip that raises the holder's critical rate by 30%.
That 30% is also added as damage even when the enemy evades or parries.
Useful for subsequent playthroughs where enemy armor stats keep rising.
Ignores 25% of enemy's defenses when attacking

Blood Sword
A demonic sword that drains the life force of whoever it slashes. Has lots
of drawbacks such as low accuracy and backfiring against undead, but
being able to attack and heal at the same time is still really handy.
Recovers 4% HP when attacking an enemy

Angel Slime Hat
An extremely helpful hat that multiplies your EXP when below a certain
level. Take full advantage of it while grinding passives from all classes.
Used to help newbie players catch up, but it's very generous nonetheless.
Increases EXP by 10% from all enemies that the holder defeats

Ancient Scepter
An item that enhances your class's fourth skill, which is almost always the
strongest available. Very useful, but you won't get it so easily - it's a
random drop, and only shows up after clearing the hardest difficulty.
Increases the holder's buff, debuff and inflicted ailment effects by 12%

Tokugawa Statue
A miraculous item that creates a new equip page, multiplying the amount of
item slots. Dropped from Pocky Rocks - some players have went 300 hours
without one. Later versions mitigated this somewhat, but it's still rare.
MP/TP +12 All Base Values +1.2

Avoid Ring
A Karma Ring which removes all enemies' press turn icons if you dodge or
negate their attacks through resistances, giving your party the initiative.
Extremely effective at endgame, which is all about resisting attacks.
Buffs all allies and debuffs all enemies slightly when an attack is dodged

Infinity Bandana
An ordinary-looking bandana with an infinity mark on it. Somehow gives
all guns unlimited ammo when it is worn. Disregarding the logistics,
this is what you get when a legendary hero with endless pride has his way.
Occasionally prevents MP consumption

Piece of Heart
The good ol' thing which you collect four of to increase your number of
hearts by 1. Make sure you collect lots of them to get a lot of hearts.
 
HP +12%

Mad Milk
Bottled white liquid. Damage done to enemies covered in this comes back
as healing by 60% of damage done. Just as unsettling as the Sniper's
Jarate. Dipping figurines in it may make things advance, in many ways.
HP +24%

Energy Tank
There are 6 in 1, 5 in 2, and about 20 in later entries.
The first one obtained doubles your max HP. Truly a lifeline.
But once you have several, additional tanks seem to be simply fillers.
HP +36%

Yggdrasil Dew
A powerful item that heals all allies' HP fully. However, it's limited in
number, doesn't revive or recover MP, and area healing spells are good
enough. Better in spinoff, where it lets all your monsters attack at once.
HP +48%

Power Bracer
An item that doubles attack EV gain when equipped. Also, a parent holding
it will pass its attack IV to the offspring. A very nice item that
greatly reduces unproductive time spent cycling back and forth.
ATK +12%

DX Mechamonkey Model
The item that stole the Golden Bear's thunder, and hadn't been seen much
lately... until it appeared as part of Goron's fleet.
 
ATK +24%

Biggest Sword Ever
The strongest weapon that fires three huge waves of unlimited range. You
may want to save your money for it at the last stage, but with just the
last boss in mind, the Raging Wave Sword's wave trails are more useful.
ATK +36%

Shinai of Spirits
Swinging it 100 times increase strength by 1. Hunger and the turn limit
may be a problem, but it's still easy to max out strength. In the hands of
an experienced player, the game is officially broken.
ATK +48%

Bulletproof Armor
Armor that protects an Earth soldier's life.
For some reason, it used to increase HP instead of defense.
About 2000 of these will make higher difficulties safer.
DEF +12%

Armored Parasite
Insect-like items that, when placed in body, improves toughness beyond
cyborg levels. When equipped, one can become as strong as Ken or Kevin.
The localization change was superfluous, no matter how you look at it.
DEF +24%

Purple Metallic Armor
From the looks of it, it's an armor meant to protect the shoulders and
chest, but when worn by a human, it's big enough to cover more. It has a
lot of yellow Noisy Boys on it too. No idea what that's supposed to mean.
DEF +36%

Reinforced Leather Armor
Bought in stores from mid-game, or won from the casino in Primm. If you
find it unsafe to stay naked until Gun Runners, farm 2000cap and this,
and head to New Vegas from Neil's Shack. Solves the entry fee too.
DEF +48%

Cantrip Book
Book that records all sort of troublesome things.
It might allow you to use all sorts of status attacks, or it might not.
 
MAG +12%

Light Staff
A light-elemental weapon that is useful against that super tough boss.
It's a pretty weapon, but doesn't really enhance the wielder's magic.
 
MAG +24%

Mana Flower
An accessory created by fusing a Nature's Gift and a Mana Potion.
Judging from its icon, it's created by just plopping the green flower
representing the Nature's Gift on the mouth of the potion bottle.
MAG +36%

Kalar's Crystal
A beautiful crystal embedded inside a Kalar's forehead. It gives the owner
strong magic power, but the Kalar from whom this is taken from will die.
If you want Craia to survive, you need to learn magic from Haniwaism.
MAG +48%

Book of Stamp Bingo
A notebook that keep track of the Stamp Bingo Rally's stamps. It's quite
fun looking for these throughout the entire game, but they can be really
well hidden. Collecting these without a guide is extremely difficult.
MND +12%

Crepe Mariette
A crepe with a caramel surface, after a flambe with Kirsch. With butter,
vanilla, brandy, and caramel, it's truly a sophisticated and tasty crepe.
 
MND +24%

Symbol of Faith
A statue placed within the Con Cave.
Screw diplomacy, just force mysterious items on them. That's how a true
savior of the world acts. Reimu and Sanae could learn from him... maybe.
MND +36%

Diva's Apron
Apron wore by divas who still have ways to go. Cute. Be warned that
wearing it will make people point fingers at you quite often.
 
MND +48%

Jagged Leaves
An item that increases agility by 1 when used. A valuable item in a game
system where agility is the difference between life and death. They tend
to be camouflaged by other green things like grass, and are easily missed.
SPD +12%

Booster v0.8
A booster that lets you go higher when you press jump while midair. If you
fall from the ledge and talk to the professor, you get this normal version
and bad things will happen later. At least its easier to master than v2.0.
SPD +24%

Pale Wing Thruster
Thrusters equipped by Space Fighters to combat aliens. Stronger than ground
soldiers in almost all situations, so it got nerfed in 3P. Rapiers' power
and range were reduced to 2/3rd, yet Master Rapier is still a top weapon.
SPD +36%

Full Custom
A chip that instantly fills the action gauge to max. It's not as broken
in 2 when one can use multiple copies of normal chips, but now it really
feels that in 2 there are more broken things than just Prism Combo.
SPD +48%

Chargin' Targe
A shield that halves fire damage and enables charging attacks. It's useful
but it's hard to discard the stickybomb launcher. Practice with the grenade
launcher if you want to use this, or forget it if you have Medic Uber on.
FIR +50

LOVE Machine 3322
A special machine whose effect changes depending on the combination of
its 4 IC chips. With a 3-3-2-2 combo, fire damage is completely negated.
Still, against that Nurse guy, even with this you're not totally safe.
FIR +100

Heater Muffler
A treasure that reduces damage from ice-elemental field magic by half.
Beginners neglect magic power, so minmaxing yours and spamming field
magic can kill them wherever they move. Though it tends to piss them off.
CLD +50

Lv70 Lover Snapper's Scale
"If you really love her, catch a 70cm one without trading. Otherwise, too
bad." There have been reports of filling up the shipping box without a
single one above 60cm. The tears make your cold resistance increase.
CLD +100

Spellbook - High Hurricane
Character exclusive spellbook containing the best wind magic. Not learnable
by levelling; you have to find it to be able to use it. Instead of buffing
someone, they should've done something about Yuki's chest armor sprites.
WND +50

Card [Ruler of Heavens]
With HP on the same level as attackers and unlimited range 2P attack at no
cost, it's the best monster amongst them all. 3 copies is standard unless
rules forbid it. In DS version its HP is reduced by 1, yet it remains uber.
WND +100

Rosebush Robe
A strong lightweight equipment found in the Dark World. One can still
remember how scary the place is, and how strong the Death Knights are.
 
NTR +50

Green Dream
An accessory obtained by collecting tree sap after Robo spent 400 years
transforming a desert to a forest. The scene where this item is used
to console a friend is, in my opinion, one of the best scenes ever.
NTR +100

Stone of Hades
To enter the lowest floor of Plane of Death, these stones are required to
bind one's souls with their body. Post-game, collecting 30 will get you
the best equipment and character by far, possibly just for postgame.
MYS +50

Star World Bracelet
Bracelet that reduces mystic damage by half. You should collect all the
chests with this item to counteract Galaxian Explosion. Even without that,
there are still many situations where mystic resistance is handy.
MYS +100

Goriki's Charm
A spiritual art that negates some damage from enemies. This becomes very
useful in the second half of the game, when your healing may not be enough
to catch up with the damage. It really makes the game quite boring though.
SPI +50

Intama
A solemnly shining orb that is said to be a robot's soul. The catalyst for
the miraculous restoration of Musashi's broken body for the final battle,
after finally arriving at Hanzou after the sacrifice of many allies.
SPI +100

Shackles
Shackles that you might think are worn by zombies. A version update nerfed
its reason to exist by preventing mass-equipping multiples of it, but it
was resurrected after another update added cheap and strong reforges to it.
DRK +50

Dark Magic Grimoire
A proof of one somehow linking up with 100 friends. Making that a condition
for this item, certain dungeons and certain allies was plain cruel. And the
bug in first releases that wiped your friends list... Many tears were shed.
DRK +100

Lucky Horseshoe
Accessory that negates damage of falling from high places. Falling from up
to 50 feet will not do a single point of damage normally, yet 1 inch more
results in grievous damage. Definitely equip this to prevent accidents.
PHY +50

Button of Aegis
Increases HP by 100, gives type advantage against White B and Black B, and
negates weaknesses. Combine this with Senna for an unbreakable wall, but
She's strong enough already, so you may want to give it to others.
PHY +100

Poison Resistance Ring
A ring that decreases poison damage to 1/3, and radiation damage to 2/5.
Without this, radiation items can permanently change parameters,
or cause freakish mutations suddenly. Try to get this before mid-game.
PSN +50

Nitroglycerin
An item that lifts Paralysis from one ally. Can be used repeatedly. If you
get it too late you might have deaths, and killing the shopkeeper to get
this results in other items becoming unobtainable. Somewhat troubling.
PAR +50

Talaria
A pair of shoes that enable the wearer to float in air. Those who try it
on right after finding it tend to hit themselves in the head.
 
HVY +50

Steadfast Ring
A ring that decreases knockback from damage. The game has an excellent
system that offers good customization and collecting fun, but it's not
present in other titles. Quite a shame.
SHK +50

Two-Face's Coin
A two-faced coin that allows one to dictate their own fortune.
It's scarred on one side.
 
TRR +50

Yamabiko Necklace
When you're Silenced and can no longer speak, this necklace somehow lets
you hear Yamabiko, thereby restoring your speech. Sometimes it can make
you hear things too. Kind of scary.
SIL +50

Courtesan's Sorrow
An item that inflicts instant death on the opposition.
Very useful for killing those high-endurance mobs in the final floor.
Can't be bought after 7th floor, so hoard them when you can.
DTH +50

Kazu's Amulet
A charm that Kazu's mother asks you to hand over to her son guarding the
watchhouse. A consumable that uses special radio waves to repel encounters
but given when you get it, you'll hesitate when using it, in many ways.
DBF +50

Bludgeon
A bludgeon created from the trunk of the Great Tree. Might have some
mysterious power within. The girls thought it too heavy, so they scraped
at it until it was thin enough to work as a staff. Poor bludgeon.
ATK/DEF +10% PHY +12 SHK +12

Piche's Bauble
A key item that can be obtained from the very beginning of the game.
An item that reminds you of a kind prince and a pitiable maiden.
The first boss's reaction to this item is quite sad.
MAG/MND +8% NTR +20 TRR +16

Light Crystal
Gems that was originally searched for to cure the plague, but as he
enters the Tower of Illusions, he will turn evil. No matter what you do,
there's no escaping it. Poor guy.
HP +10% MND +10% DRK +25 DTH +20

Purple Dragon Crystal
A crystal that's large enough to grip, and shines with rainbow colors when
raised. Obtaining it allows one to transform into a dragon, but it's
worrisome whether that's really alright with this world's settings.
All Stats +8%

Super-Hard Rye Bread
Leave a Rye Bread in your room for a long time, and you get this. For
whatever reason, using the item deals skills-like damage to a large area.
Thus, lots of bread tend to get left all over her house. What a witch.
ATK/MAG +16% ACC +10 PSN +20

Sirloin
A high quality meat that, when tossed, can sometimes convince foe monsters
to join your side. Makes your own monsters more loyal to you too.
 
HP +24% DEF/MND +8% PAR +20

Uniform of Exorcism
The winter uniform of the demon hunter. Due to magic inherited down from
generations of exorcists, it has powerful defenses despite what its
appearance may lead you to believe.
DEF/MND +20% EVA +10 MYS/SPI/DRK +24

Glow Crystal
When used in tempering, it gives the "Nymph of Dawn" power to weapons.
Weapons imbued with Nymph of Dawn requires less energy to increase
essence levels, which is vitally important to weapon tempering in general.
HP +10% MAG/MND +20% FIR/CLD/WND/NTR+24

Bone Stake
A completely featureless weapon. Quite dangerous. If one forgets to buy
it at the beginning, it won't be obtained until much later, after one
completes the Faerie Palace.

Blade Cusinart
A disastrous blade that shreds enemies to pieces. With its high-speed
revolving tip, an innumerable amount of meat for cooking was cut by it.
This terrifying power is the loyal ally of today's housewives.
MP +1 ATK +24% DEF/MAG/MND/SPD +6% All Affinities +12

Flipskirt Dagger
A weapon that increases both attack and magic. It's the strongest dagger
in the original, but few characters use both stats, and in Magnum it's
it's completely outclassed by the Ultra Sword. The poor thing.
ATK +24% MAG +20% SPD +10% DBF +20

Ultrafast Granite Keystone
Just place it, and it will emit a special field that totally draws out the
potential of anything and make it much more awesome and stuff. It involves
so much breakthrough technology that everything about it is a mystery.
All Stats +12% ACC/EVA +8 All Resistances +12

Luster Candy
A candy that boosts all stats at once, so named because everyone lusts
after it, but you can-die before you ever see one. A skill that took the
buffing role from Makakaja, but you can expect greater things from now on.
HP +32% ATK/DEF +24%  ACC/EVA +16

Getitup V
A medicine that makes a certain part of your body extremely healthy.
It seems like something vampires drink when they want to show their true
form, but this kind of true form is desired only by that vampire anyway.
TP +2 All Stats +20%

Water Cutting Sword
A weapon effective against aquatic enemies. It's so important that one
must obtain it before 20F, no matter what the cost is. Basically it's all
those Gyazaas' fault. Because of this, Gyazaas are hugely nerfed in nequel.
HP/ATK/MAG +20% CLD +60 PAR/SIL +20

Hero's Medal
A medal that heroes of the world are allowed to carry. It has bronze,
silver and gold versions. The antag having a Gold one makes one wonder what
kind of hijinks he was up to when he was younger.
MP +1 ATK/MAG +12% MND +40% FIR/PHY +30

Happy Hat
How one uses lucky equipment. An item that recovers MP by walking in a
game where MP recovery is scarce. Since MP doesn't really go up in this
game, even 1 MP remains important, adding to this equipment's usefulness.
TRR/SIL/DTH/DBF +10 Recover 1 MP if at the front at end of battle

Big Bang Waganizer
Special level 4 equipment that uses a lot of Battery to clear the screen.
A useful technique in a game where the player lacks much means to remove
enemies, but the amount of Battery expended for this is quite overcharged.
MAG +30% SPD +16% FIR/WND/SPI/DRK +32

Scouter
A gadget that measures your opponent's battle power. It always does its
job perfectly, yet it constantly gets accused of not working correctly
and gets broken to pieces as a result. The poor thing.
MP +1 TP +1 +10% damage when targeting the enemy's weakness

Toadstoolshed
A most valuable fruit that increases all of a pet's stats. "I've heard of
it but I've never seen it", is what most say of it. Combining a Spiny Seed
with a neutral colour seed results in a small chance of getting one.
All Affinities +24 All Resistances +12

Demon Core
A chunk of plutonium that was used in the prototype atomic bomb after all
kinds of experiments. So named after it killed two scientists after going
critical in experiments. But really, the methodology was like a bad joke.
HP/MAG +24% TRR/SIL/DTH/DBF +20

Pride
Head parts that can emit a super 77-power beam. It can only hold one shot,
but if carefully used, it can be used to snipe tough enemy leaders with its
critically high damage. Gets you through the worst situations late-game.
ATK +48% MND +24% FIR +48 SHK +24

Damascus Dread Shield
The strongest shield created from the strongest material, Damascus. Get 32
Damascus Casserole Shields by 32 playthroughs, or spend about 300 wooden
shields making it from scratch. For me, I think 32 playthroughs is quicker.
DEF +32% MND +30% EVA +12 PHY +30

T-45d Power Armor
Power Armor developed by America for defending Alaska in the Sino-American
War. Lost some of its defensive abilities from the 200 years, but Capital
Wasteland still regards it as a symbol of its previously powerful culture.
DEF +30% ATK/MAG/MND +16% FIR/CLD/WND/PHY +24

Tisiphone Edge
A weapon that can hit up to seven times with its unleash, Vengeance.
With equipment that increase critical to 100% it can do really high damage,
but with those equipment, Sol Blade actually has better average damage.
ATK +16% MAG +40% SPD +24% WND/MYS+40

Forbidden Tablet
A tablet containing forbidden magic. Even amongst hardcore gamers, tales
of obtaining one is rare. A nightmarish difficult item to obtain.  Sadly,
their practical worth doesn't make up for the difficulty of obtaining one.
MP+1 MAG +56% MND +26% MYS/SPI/DRK +40

The Arch
It is shaped like a bow, but the frame part is actually a rapidly spinning
buzz-saw-like blade of light. With a brilliant white glow, she's truly a
work of art. Not a seam on her.
MP +1 TP +1 HP +32% SPD +24% ACC/EVA +24

Lambda Driver
A system that converts emotion and willpower into physical energy.
An important mechanism that is instrumental in that punch scene
that even got used in that robot crossover game.
All Stats +20% All Affinities +20

Portable Oscillation Cannon
Powerful armament equipped by the Kazu'uchi Tsurugi 00-Dragoon Armor.
Strong enough that a direct hit destroys a Shin'uchi Tsurugi. With stealth
as well, it marks the end of the era of the Shin'uchi "Samurai" caste.
ATK/MAG +50%

Century's End Jacket
Jacket with the aura of the end of the century. Females wear these to look
wild and sexy. A definite must for those with large chests.
 
TP +2 HP/MND +36% DEF +24% EVA +20

Glaive of Pain
An easy to use weapon with no special abilities, but extremely high power.
However, it has no disenchant resistance, so without due care, it becomes
no stronger than store-bought weapons. Use disenchant resist armor with it.
ATK +76% DRK +32

Asura Blade
A truly ultimate weapon that has the highest attack, doesn't decay, and
hits 1-3 times per attack. The protagonist isn't actually good enough to
make use of it. Let Ryu handle attacking, and have the protag use items.
ATK +40% SPD +30% ACC +16

Wallbreaker Armband
A huge help and drag in the extra dungeon. Move diagonally at
corners to enter walls. 10 damage is taken every turn within the wall, but
it's nothing compared to the foes. This + Sense is a guaranteed clear.
SPD +56% ACC +40 EVA +20

Energy Pack
Obtained by delivering the capsules to Dr. Matsushita. Despite its
simple name, it actually fully heals everyone's HP and BP. BP is used for
pretty much all actions, making BP recovery a veritable lifeline.
MP +1 TP +3 HP +50% DEF/MND +20%

Drum
...Push push! Push those drums! Ain't it nostalgic!? Actually though, in
that tower, this is both mandatory and kind of annoying. If you touch
the wrong chests, those drums will definitely give you hell.
TP +4 DEF/MND +48% FIR/WND/PHY +32

Regenerador's Heart
The heart of everyone's favourite idol monster. It's actually not a
heart, but the parasite core within the body. Their first scene, the map
structure and their "cuteness" made quite the impact on most players.
HP +128% MYS/DRK +50 PSN/PAR/TRR +50

The Bee
The most powerful of Amplifier Shields, which gives "Amp Damage" bonuses
when the shield is undamaged. Unlike other Amp Shields, it has 0 amp shot
drain. A really obvious game-breaker, but outdated by the 3rd playthrough.
HP/DEF/MND +20%  +12% damage when at full HP

Star of Elendil
A shining gemstone that is the symbol of the status of Arnor throne.
Its starlight brightens all around it.

Blue Saber
Known as the "Crazy Sword", because one'd have to be crazy to endure
getting it. Using stat tables to figure out its mods, using poison damage to
figure out map ranks, people still do research even now. Crazies.
MP +1 ATK +50% DEF/MAG/MND/SPD +25%

Wash Basin Set
Perhaps they look like garbage, but complete the whole set and it gives
all stats +50, which is good enough for even a little into post-game.
Manipulating the RNG to get a lot of these early makes the game boring.
ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD +50%

Meteor Drive
The best engine, obtainable mid-game, dropped rarely by Speed King. It
makes the rest of the game easy, but Speed King is tough and the drop rate
is awful.
DEF/MND +24% SPD +72% EVA +12 WND +64 HVY +32

Olzhas Shamshir
An illusionary sword. It's even stronger than the STR+28801 Sun Sword,
but you can't get it without Kettai in your party. Since Kettai is a late
bloomer, having Kettai wielding this sword is quite a sight to behold.
ATK +64% DEF +48% FIR/MYS +48

War Mask of the Butcher
The mask of the commander of several tribes, united under the "Legion"
name. If you think human bosses in the series are all fodder, this
guy will prove you wrong. Even NCR would have problems with him.
ATK/DEF/MND +72% TRR/SIL/DTH/DBF +24

Divine Barrier
A property that reduces all damage. Angels and Demons tend to have this.
Higher Demons tend to have very strong Divine Barriers that make them
essentially invulnerable, so make sure you have Exorcism weapons for them.
DEF/MND +88% FIR/CLD/WND/NTR +40

Lilium's Panties
The panties of the "324KB Death God." No human alive could win against
that thing one-on-one... or so you would think, but apparently such people
do actually exist. The world sure is big.
MP +2 TP +2 MAG +50% MND/SPD +80% ACC/EVA +20

Megasphere
A dream-like item that instantly increases health and armor to 200%. If you
see this in end-game, you can bet that all hell will be breaking loose.
Even with both maxed out to 200%, you can and will still die in an instant.
HP +160% DEF/MND +32% HP Recovery Rate +2

Costume - Ninja Lord
The last of the thief progression. Has the highest speed, strong attacks and
regeneration. Although the game suggests character costumes, thanks to the
difficulty and growth rates, only this and last boss's costume are viable.
ATK/MAG +20% SPD +120% EVA +25 DTH +40

Grand Master Breaker Title

especially the ones which involve hunting dragons and phantoms.

Astral Dominae
The highest artifact hidden in the heart of new planet. The entire
universe is recorded in it. An event which led to it being found and fought
over by several groups was controversial due to its worldview changing.
MAG +100% MND +66% MP Recovery Rate +1 SPI/DRK +50

Cinderforge Sword
Legendary katana created in the 7th century, held by the sage of the dead.
The strongest sword normally, but the sword character has fixed equips,
and others get a serious JP penalty using it, so it's not really used much.
ATK +120% DEF +80% PHY +60 HVY/DBF +30

Holy Sword Gran Centurio
A giant holy sword that can only be used by a certain royal family.
It's as big and heavy as a human, but to the royal family it is light as a
feather. It'll cut you down whether you come close or not.
ATK/MAG +64% SPD +100% MYS/SPI/DRK +48 HP Recovery Rate +2

Ame-no-Murakumo
One of the three sacred treasures. Found in Yamata-no-Orochi's tail, and
also called the Kusanagi. After Susanoo offered it to Amaterasu, it passed
to the hand of Ninigi, but with the demise of Taira it sunk to the ocean.
All Stats +160%

Compact Arm
Also known as Salmon Eggs, due to its bullets. SR+3 and H+3, and feared
due to playing dead then striking fast with rapid-fire and homing bullets.
Great at close-mid ranges, and a serious force with the Homing Eye.
HP +44% MAG +88% SPD +66% ACC +24

Flamelong Sword
A sword needed to create the powerful Lightlong Sword. It only has a low
chance to drop from the event battle after clearing the Save Point-less
Barrier Dungeon, and it's lost forever after a certain point. Annoying.
MP +2 ATK +88% FIR +80 FIR Damage dealt +10%

Angel Ring
A head equipment to die for, so much that you want to keep it on for life.
You need it to enter that Heaven-like place you'll never want to leave, and
it can't be removed until after. And it still remains at 1 DEF.
DEF +1% MND +128% WND +100 PAR/SHK/TRR +60

Angelic Armor
An armor that allows you to fly for a few seconds after a jump. It
increases your movement range by a lot, but the spawn frequency and hitbox
generation of enemies is so fast, "accidents" tend to strip it off quickly.
DEF +88% MND/SPD +44% SPI/DRK/PHY +44

Cyber Elf - Grandie
The best effect in all of the Cyber Elves, doubling Zero's vitality. But it
and all other Elves have a mission points penalty after use, so no one uses
it. And apparently, the Elf dies after using it too. What a bad aftertaste.
HP +240% HP Recovery Rate +1

Lenderbaffe's Dragon Scale
Scale of a dragon faster than even "that". Good for defiling princesses
with. Blowing up the Church of Memories with Inspire is a standard by now.

ATK/DEF/MAG/MND +40% SPD +80%

AGC Warhead
Officially the Anti-Generator Chemical Warhead. A thermonuclear warhead
that was used to destroy mankind's greatest enemy, the Accumulated
Crystal Form. Of course, Gensokyo doesn't have the facilities to use it.
HP/MAG +102%

The Katana of Anubis
It's base power is low, but it boasts a miraculous +4 number of attacks.
Its leans more to mages than warriors, but with Anti-Teleport, Anti-Sense
and Chaos affinity, it messes with mages' situation controlling skills.
ATK/SPD +102%

Cobra Sniper Rifle
Blue unique sniper rifles dropped -sometimes- by DLC-only enemies have a
0.88% chance to be transformed into a Cobra type. Because of the chance of
it dropping, it can make any player weep in desperation from farming it.
ATK/MAG +88% MND +48% ACC +48 EVA +24

HEV Suit
A hazard suit with high protection. Its effectiveness increases even more
when a mustache'd physicist wears it. Goes especially well with crowbars,
boasting otherworldly monster and special forces-dispatching powers.
DEF +144% All Affinities +24 All Resistances +24

Star Pendant
An equipment for the body which boasts the highest defense, and gives

of course. Everyone can equip it, which is both a blessing and a curse.
MND +144% FIR/CLD/WND +60 PAR/SHK +60

Genji Glove
It was equipped by Elmdore, who appears in Limberry Castle. The Genji
Armor set only shows up this one time. Although the steal rate displays as
0%, the display doesn't count decimals, so its really just a low % chance.
ATK/MND/SPD +128%  Occasionally deals double damage

Zeus' Armor
The strongest armor that can be worn. Found near a port at the start with
no explanation. With this and the 220mm Gaia, they must like to do this to
their best equips. It doesn't guarantee wins from midgame onwards though.
HP/DEF/MAG +128%  Ocasionally nulls damage taken

Shuttle Body
The strongest equipment, made from 2 special protectors given to you by an
your allies near death. Has high defense and resists all ailments.
Couldn't they do something about the 'Give it to the Hag' message, though?
DEF/MND +100% All Resistances +56

Smasher "Mjolnir"
A lightning warhammer made for the famous blonde-haired hero. Often
written as "Mjollner," but "Mjolnir" is from the source. Hard-to-pronounce
divine weapon that summons thunder and returns to the user when thrown.
MP +2 TP +8 All Stats +72% WND +150 WND Damage dealt +10%

Great Question's Mask
A mask from an event that no one cares about, gotten by beating a boss
at the top of an annoying tower no one cares about. It seems like a
joke item, but its stats are great, and the boost to Papillon form is huge.
All Stats +100%

Chinchirorin Custom Dice
A dice with its dots carved by a t-bone from a steak, and painted red with
blood such that all sides show "1" only. If you point out that dried blood
should be black, then you should learn a little something called "tact."
HP/ATK/DEF +128% TRR/SIL +40 HP Recovery Rate +2

Nodachi "Kotetsu"
The main weapon of Seishuu Uemonnojou Muramasa the Third. The original

it gained Ginseigou's gravity control, and a bit of Chachamaru's power.

Quartz Charm
Your reward for defeating the secret boss. Increases offense and defense by

before and during battle is kinda funny. His crystals are oddly unpopular.

Large Macaron Collider
This grand device was built in order to study the basis of all in the world

Silver Cat Statue
A Piece of Heart, basically. Collecting them not only increases your
survivability, but getting them all is also needed for the true ending.
Makes it a pain when some of them are behind points of no return.
HP +160%

Vitality Seed
Increases the selected character's vitality stat by 1-3 points. Use it
when vitality is at 255 to make it buffer overflow to 0, causing HP to
rise like crazy. Otherwise, it's just a trap that lowers your HP growth.
HP +240%

Health Tablets
These folks used to heal injuries from zombie bites by munching on herbs,
but they've moved on to herb tablets instead. To prevent the spread of the
C-Virus, they should probably research herbs instead of doing blood tests.
HP +320%

Ambrosia
A miraculous artifact that increases an ally's max DME by 6,000. Most
suited for mages with low DME for a survivability boost, though two
Bracelets of Zoe at each level-up is enough to cap every character's DME.
HP +400%

Sword of Nex
A sword equippable by Warriors. Quite powerful for when you can get it,
and it even has accuracy+10. Very useful indeed.
 
ATK +160%

Super Sledge
Known as the better Sledgehammer. Best damage per hit in the game, and
does respectable damage to armored foes at endgame. Can be gotten early
by going north, but you likely won't meet the STR and skill reqs then.
ATK +240%

Burst Laser Mark II
Spaceship weapon that fires 3 lasers at 1 damage each. Boasts strong cost
performance with only 2 power required and a decent charge time for 3
lasers. A strong weapon said to be the most efficient of all available.
ATK +320%

Holy Sword Virdalik
The strongest physical weapon available to Holy Knights and Mage Knights.
However, it may get lost via inheritance, and by the latter half of the
game, character base stats are so high that weapons don't really matter.
ATK +400%

Buzz Buzz's Shell
Shell of a hero who traveled back in time to inform the Chosen One of the
coming crisis before meeting an honorable death. May grant latent psychic
powers and is likely pretty solid given the damage done via a mere tackle.
DEF +160%

Arhat Vajra
Best arm equipped dagger. It boasts good stats and hit counts,
but you can only find it from Cheap Tricks deep in the last dungeon at a
low drop rate. Get it when you're doing your third playthrough for that MA.
DEF +240%

Outlaw's Bandanna
Head equip of the Outlaw series, wearable at Lv50 onwards. You might get
heckled for wearing something that looks like it came from Uniqlo, but
it was actually very good with Lv80-worthy DEF and many jobs can equip it.
DEF +320%

Barrier Glove
Arm equip gotten at endgame. It doesn't provide much DEF, but having it
equipped on anyone automatically removes 500 BP at the start of battle and
reduces damage taken for the first turn. Useful for offense and defense.
DEF +400%

Nanna
An ice bow boasting a Mesopotamian goddess's name. Good against flyers
and the only bow with +ATK. You can get all the jewels from the last boss
just by keeping away and firing, but its not great against multiple foes.
MAG +160%

White Soul Music Sheet
A music sheet needed to learn the final song. "Terrible stats"
for an endgame skill, but needed to trigger the special victory condition
at the final battle. Sakura's tearful screaming cut-in was wonderful.
MAG +240%

Rhapsody in Rose
One of big sis Lightning's costumes. Very showy and garish - Yukari or
Hijiri should try wearing it. A color change makes it more tasteful though.
Default 100 ATB, Energized status and one locked ability - useful indeed.
MAG +320%

Ether Doubler
Accessory that doubles EP cost and effectiveness. A trap item of sorts,
as it's relatively useless at the start when Ether skills aren't great,
and stores stop selling them by mid-game when they become worthwhile.
MAG +400%

Kigny Seed
An item thrown by the strongest radish monster, also known as "Fuck
Radishes." Puts you in a Berserk state for 30 turns. Appears around 90F,
where Berserk is a death sentence. In 4 and below, just don't get close.
MND +160%

Princess's ???
An item receivable under differing situations, but mostly from checking
Yoyo's bed. Rush and the merchant makes the ??? sound like an amulet, but
that doesn't sound like something she'd have. Also heals full party HP.
MND +240%

Helix Fossil
A device bestowed by the gods to bless the holder with the voices of
100,000 otherworldly guests. Entrust it to your brow to learn about life,
the universe, and everything... but it doesn't ensure a smooth playthrough.
MND +320%

Schwarzschild Horizon
A kind of barrier that might actually protect Maud more than you. Maybe.
It definitely has a high DEF stat. Maybe. The surface of a Schwarzschild
Radius may be known as this, so it's likely impossible to penetrate. Maybe.
MND +400%

Zenithian's Wing
Wing from a Zenithian causing a stir at a tall tree. Keep her in your
wagon, or else she leaves and gives you a weaker dragon than the one in 6.
High chances of useful actions makes her better than the Thwackdemon.
SPD +160%

Infringer
The first serious Tsurugi submitted by Tomoi for the yearly Armor Battle
Tournament sponsored by Tamura and co. Complete with a center-def double
deck yootz steel frame and a torque splitter belt drive. Probably fast.
SPD +240%

Kicker Skeleton's Soul
The famous soul that allows you to perform a downward kick with Down+A
during a double-jump. Acquiring this turns you abnormal. You can't do kicks
as quickly in a normal playthrough, but using it still speeds things up.
SPD +320%

Quick Boost
A NEXT-generation mechanism that uses particles to give an instant
speed boost, matching speeds that their forbearers needed all their energy
to reach. Use sparingly - the particles are bad for the skin and ecosystem.
SPD +400%

Sleep DX
A human-only tool that puts an enemy to sleep. Insanely powerful as no
enemy or boss, including the last boss, has 100% sleep resist except for
machine enemies. But in that case, why does it work on AIs?
MND +100% PSN/PAR +50

Blue Dragon Wok
The Wok's ultimate form. Who knows what exactly Blue Dragons have to do
with woks, but it sure looks weird. It's a surprisingly strong weapon with
no frills, but it doesn't get much use as its wielder is weak and ugly.
ATK +100% PSN/DBF +50

Time Cap
A key item which, when equipped, allows you to deal effective damage to
the last boss. You'd think there'd be other ways, but there isn't. The item
allows you to stop time and perform actions without reply for 5 turns.
HP+100% PAR/SHK +50

Nerve Shells
Bullet used by guns. Deals damage and inflicts Sleep. Given the Almighty
element to deal DEF-ignoring damage. Truly heinous. Same effect as Magic
Shells, but more famous due to how early and easily you can get them.
SPD +100%, HVY/SIL +50

Sky Armor
Armor forgable from the scales dropped by the strongest random enemy, Sky
Dragon. ...Or it was supposed to be, but all armor shops are unavailable
when they appear. You have to farm the armor itself off Dragon Masters.
DEF +100% HVY/DTH +50

Hyakutaro's Chi Manual
A book with the teachings of the Chi master who appears mid-game as a
a hostage. He may seem strong with invincibility and homing Hadoukens, but
they only do 1 bullet's damage each. Still good to have him around, mind.
ATK +100% SHK/TRR +50

Paladin's Necklace
A necklace that reflects all spells. Win Antokiba's monthly tournament to
get it. Wearing it uncurses all equips and gives constant Survey status,
displaying all visible enemy's stats and making next playthroughs easier.
MAG +100% TRR/DBF +50

Nunchucks of Sokuromoto
The beloved nunchucks of the legendary Bunroku, a compassionate ninja with
a heartbreaking past. Allows mastery over ice and holds enough power to
pierce Professor Chaos's titanium alloy cloak. Let's fighting love...
SPD +100% SIL/DTH +50

Portable Makoto
The guy returns once again in a portable size! Caress him tenderly, put
him in your bag, grow him in a flowerpot, or even hug him while on top of
a boat! Find your own way to give him the love only you can provide.
HP +144% PSN/PAR/HVY/SHK +50

Meld Technique Manual
A book with teachings that unlocks the power to make full use of items,
allowing you the puzzling ability to equip armor, potions, and so on all
over yourself. Use this ability to take down Chaos.
ATK +144% TRR/SIL/DTH/DBF +50

Earth Armor
Valuable armor which you get several of from chests. Less DEF than other
body gear like Silver Armor, but being wearable by light and heavy armor
classes and status immunity (...supposedly) makes it very useful still.
DEF +172% All Resistances +50

Ignigarde
Can be gotten by giving exchanging a boss drop with someone else, or by
beating him. Can be traded for Cyclone Shoes. Both are sold in the giants'
village, so you can get both easily while doing a 3 ending quests run.
DEF +100% FIR/CLD +172

Gaia Beam
One of the six infamously rare items in EB, and an ultimate weapon.
Not too useful as its user does more damage by using items, but the joy of
getting a rare ultimate weapon drop is always an emotional ride.
MAG +100% WND/NTR +172

Dhylec
A blade sealed deep within a certain temple. Can amplify magic power, but
is normally supressed by prayer beads. As a netherworldlian, it has other
abilities too. The way it pouts and sleeps if left alone is kind of cute.
MND +100% MYS/SPI +172

Magnus Club
A melee divine weapon. Very short range, but has very short charge times,
activates quickly and a large horizontal AOE. Its hype died down after the
release, but skill synergy discovered later brought the hype right back.
ATK +100% DRK/PHY +172

Burned Man's Headwrap
Bandages worn by the Legion's "Living Legend." The person himself lives up
to the fear shown towards him by that battle-crazed group. May look light,
but it gives more DT than power armor made before the apocalypse.
HP +128% FIR/WND/MYS +144

Anima Crystal
A rare item that a surprising amount of players miss. Gives large SP Def
and bonuses when equipped, making its other use as a consumable full heal
unpalatable, unless you're near-wiped close to the last boss.
MAG +128% CLD/NTR/PHY +144

Windspun Armor
A piece of armor with no weaknesses - highest DEF, wind resist and even
a speed boost. Its one issue is that only heavy armor classes can wear it.
Give it to someone in 1 and he'll come with it in 2 after importing data.
DEF +128% WND/SPI/DRK +144

Hirami Lemon
A fruit defying its divine providence by holding a secret unusual effect -
it can suppress the power of the Archfiend. Probably doesn't work on an
awakened one, though. Supposedly sour and thankfully grows everywhere.
MND +128% NTR/DRK/PHY +144

Romancing Stone
The ultimate Romancing Stone made from combining the four others. Loses
the effects of the 4 stones, but reduces MP consumption for skills to 0 in
return. Give it to characters with high-MP skills and watch the havoc.
MAG +144% FIR/CLD/WND/NTR +128

Younger Brother's Mushrooms
The mushroom set sold by the younger brother, who was apparently already an
adult before the harem event. Stuff your dragons with them for big stat
boosts, but also in the ? stat, sending them down the Black Dragon path.
MND +144% MYS/SPI/DRK/PHY +128

Seven Stars Sword
A sword with seven stars engraved in it, a symbol of the cosmic forces in
Taoism. Said to be able to banish evil and seal demons. It not only shows
the seven stars, but further three-star constellations and clouds as well.
All Stats +128% All Affinities +128

Destroy Decomposer
The highest-output form of the gun-shaped enforcement system.
This form is meant for drones and to create entry points into buildings.
For the most part, only other forms are allowed to be used against humans.
ATK +156% MAG/MND/SPD +64% TRR/SHK +24

Fusion
The thinner of the swordmaster's swords. This sword's normal attack and
setup moves make it generally more used, but it just can't get the
spotlight no matter what - the cutscenes tend to focus on Lumina instead.
HP +64% ATK +100% SPD +188% WND/PHY +48

More Mysterious Scroll
An extremely rare scroll from the More Magical Dungeon. It can't be seen
without things like a Shadow Ring, though you can still pick it up, which
shows a "Picked up ." message and your item list will have a blank space.
MAG +188% MND +124% EVA +24 DBF +60

Transforman
An item that allows you access to all the jobs at the start of a new game.
Having access to all 90 jobs and their respective skills sounds strong, but
there are several jobs which need link cabling or quest items first.
All Stats +80%

Mark2 Lancer Assault Rifle
Staple assault rifle of the army ...Which makes it sound normal, except for
the chainsaw where the bayonet should be. As dynamic as it sounds.
Slicing up stomachs works decently even on Insane, so get chainsawing!
HP +199% ATK/DEF +124% TRR/DTH +48

Zero-Shift Program
A program which was essentially made to implant certain things into the
main heroine. ...Which is what half the main game is about, more or
less. Zero-Shift is so strong that it changes the game once you get it.
HP/ATK/MAG +72% SPD/MND +164% EVA +36

Copy Ability "Smash"
A copy ability acquired by eating the strongest hand. Efficient and useful,
allowing access to three different kinds of weapons. Also helpful for
exploration by pounding stakes, cutting strings, etc with just one copy.
HP/ATK +144% DEF/MND/SPD +72% SHK +64

SwifteRock Hammer
Hammer forged from SwifteRock. Only hammers and axes should use it
over DiorWood as the primary material. Full freedom in naming weapons was
good fun as a kid - just don't look back on it again when you're an adult.
ATK +256% DEF +120% SHK/DTH +32

Dragon God Sword
A sword with the power of Thunder God and Wind God, enhanced by an inserted
Dragon Orb. Besides amplifying the power of the God Swords, it also
enhances the other six orbs, giving the holder even more abilities to use.
MAG +244% ATK/MND +64% FIR/CLD/WND/NTR/MYS/SPI/DRK +32

Noon Queen
A miraculous shield that can reduce damage taken during daytime by
60%. Very strong. It does increase damage taken at night, but most of those
are instant KOs anyway, and there's no night in the Tunnel of Origins too.
DEF/MND +144% SPI +100 PSN/DBF +40

Breach Bomb
A weapon that self-teleports over short distances and ignores shields to
damage the enemy's systems and create a breach, causing crew suffocation
deaths. Fire another one when the repair squad arrives for more carnage.
HP/MAG +176% MP +1 TP +3 EVA +32 DRK +88

D-Ratio 1/4
Used to denote ability to link with dragons. Original is 1/1, dragon copy
is 1/2, and a human's highest possible ratio is 1/4. 1/64 and above are
basically elites. Going for 1/4 means preparing from the first playthrough.
HP +256%, ATK/DEF/MAG/MND +64%

Robe of Lords
The best robe. Grants Wind immunity, and more vitally, increases Speed,
Strength, Spirit and Magic by 1. The only body equip that raises Strength
and Speed for casters. If you want maxed stats, don't level without these.
MP +2 MAG +288% SPD +100% WND +128 HVY +60

Noblesse Oblige Cellphone
Special cellphone with \10b stored in digital credit form. Use it to talk
with a concierge to spend credits for wishes. Wishes can cause accidents at
airports or assist murders, but don't go bankrupt before you "save Japan."
HP +160% TP +2 SPD +144% EVA +20 All Affinities +36 All Resistances +16

Rhododendron Dress
The dress worn by the world famous brand's top model, who emerged
victorious in 3 straight Cloth Roads. Tailored with specialities to make
full use of her combat sense and physical strengths. Pure beauty and brawn.
MAG +222% HP/ATK/SPD +112% WND/NTR/DRK +64 HP Recovery Rate +1

Ancient Overlord
The short sword wielded by the king as he fell into madness and started
slaughtering subjects and countrymen alike. High power, combo hits and
surprising reach. Only lacking in magic, but still overall the best weapon.
ATK/SPD +199% DEF/MAG +66% DRK +72 TRR/DTH +40 DBF +20

Demonica
A futuristic composite device worn by ordinary people during special
missions. Known as the "Gold Bucket" for its polished and beautiful form.
Has a learning AI, making itself progressively stronger with each battle.
DEF +144%, HP/ATK/MAG/MND/SPD +100%

Hub.BAT
A key item that allows transformation into the ultimate Navi. Gives access
to four different styles at the same time, and powerful special effects
as well. Has a large HP penalty attached though. Hard to get in all games.
MP +2 TP+2 SPD +210% DEF/MND +144% EVA +24 FIR/CLD/WND/NTR +50

Deity Emperor's Uniform
The white school uniform worn by a student who gained all sorts of powers
and suddenly proclaimed himself as the "Deity Emperor." Not that he used it
well - he's easy to beat in battle. Should've used them to fix his complex.
MAG/MND +200% HP/DEF +150% MYS/SPI/DRK +50 SIL/DBF +25

Hrathnir
A sword with its own will. Its holder becomes recognized as a legendary
knight. Casts LORTO with no limits, but its faster to just
whack them with the sword. The only item with a single non-generic name.
ATK/DEF +232% MND/SPD +144% WND/PHY +64

Rasklapanje's Parasite
The leech-like controller inside the body of the lovable mascot.
Can detach its body parts to attack you even after you destroy its innards,
and comes in packs. Even if you kill all of one, it just resurrects later.
HP +322% HP Recovery Rate +2 ATK/DEF/MAG/MND +56% TRR/DTH +24

TNT Paranoia
A brutal Soldier-only weapon. Fires large amounts of explosives upwards,
bringing a rain of explosions. Not that strong against a single enemy, but
great against groups. Almost required to clear the endgame no-tanks areas.
ATK +300% HP/SPD +132% FIR +50

Excalibolg
A weapon with a name that was obviously two famous you-know-whats
mashed together. Looks like a spiked club. Often smashes a human's upper
body into tiny bits, but no one knows if it's due to the weapon or user.
HP/ATK/MAG +216% SPI/PHY +64

Fatima
A computer displayed in human form, embedded in a robot's head. Used to
eclipse Haro as the highest mobility item, but with its series rarely
appearing and its own lore retconned, it hasn't been used any more.
MAG +188% MND/SPD +277% EVA +24 FIR/CLD/WND +40

Philosopher's Stone
The ultra-rare item with so many depictions finally appears in Gensokyo.
It may be mercury, a red light, a blue stone, or even an item that casts
healing magic. Given its name, it must enhance magic power somehow.
HP +164% MP +2 MAG/MND +278% MYS +64 DBF +32

National Defense Divinity
Demons summoned from the Imperial Army in WW2. They're more like
divine or heroic spirits, each one representing a powerful being in eastern
legend. They have a way with words - some of their lines are very quotable.
ATK/DEF/MAG/MND +188% CLD/WND/DRK +56

Uruncel Blade
A dagger that raises ATK and MAG, gives +10% to all stats, gives an extra
hit per attack, and has a hidden Growth R effect. The more you use it, the
stronger it gets. Possibly the strongest weapon in the game. Poor Chaos.
MP +1 TP +2 ATK +278% MAG/SPD +188% PHY +50

Arturos Gem
A diamond named after the King of the Knights of the Round Table. Gotten
from an enemy who only appears when you're at low HP in the Iron Maiden.
Increases damage greatly against pretty much everything. Basically broken.
All Stats +156% All Affinities +36

Unknowns
Unmanned suicide weapons created using ancient technology. Devestated the
land after ending Destroyboy. Proves strength in numbers. The mood created
by the fade-out and BGM as your mecha gets whittled down was incredible.
ATK/SPD +312% EVA +20 HVY/SHK/TRR +32

Dark Knight's Armor
The armor of the poor cactus, who turns into the Dark Knight if you game
over, or if you beat the game. Its appearance makes it look strong, but
given how unwieldy his controls are, wearing this may not actually help.
HP +128% DEF +300% MND +156% MYS/DRK/PHY +72 DTH +36

Zenith Dragon's Heart
The heart of the "almighty" dragon who gets on the player's nerves in 4 and
shows how useless he is in 5. Can be (difficultly) gotten by dealing 50k HP
damage within 30T. May or may not be related to the Alabast Dragon.
HP/DEF/MAG/MND +199% FIR/WND/SPI +50 All Resistances +20

Rubiss Sword
The strongest sword with a fitting name for the curtain-closer of the first
trilogy. Gotten from a secret boss whose conditions are harder to meet than
the actual boss fight. Casts Thordain and is equippable by all classes.
MP +2 MAG +250% HP/ATK/MND +200% FIR/CLD/SPI +40 WND +100

Bathus's Claymore
The sword of the world's strongest man. Unleashes a defenses-ignoring AOE
every turn. Evadable, so reaching the final floor means crazy EVA training.
Get Regalias and Ultimas ready for the 4 equally strong bosses ahead too.
ATK +399% DEF +199% PHY +88 PSN/PAR/TRR +32

Gun del Sol - Infinite
A solar energy gun with the best battery equipped. A wonderful piece of
equipment that does what it says on the tin, letting you use the Gun Del
Sol freely, but it's far from simple to actually get.
HP +444% MP +2 TP +2 ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD +99% SPI/DRK +99

Destructive Falcon Sword
A sword created by abusing a famous bug. A crazy weapon that removes the
curse while keeping the power and even hitting twice per turn. Just don't
let it revert. Even with it, the endgame is still gonna be tough.
ATK/SPD +375% DTH +50

Paladin's Shield
A strong shield, gotten by equipping the Cursed Shield for 256 battles. Can
teach Ultima, perhaps as a backup if you chose the Ragnarok sword. Can't
be said to be THE best shield pre-remake thanks to the Evade bug, sadly.
DEF +450% MND +225% EVA +12 FIR/CLD/SPI/DRK/PHY +70 DBF +50

Andreal Claws
The strongest claw. As strong as dad's weakest weapons, but some
monsters can only be recruited using these claws with its high rates. Hard
to get a second pair, so don't lose the story-mandated ones.
TP +4 ATK +177% MAG/SPD +277% TRR/SIL +64

Fairy "Navi"
Hey! Listen! Listen! Watch out! Hey! Heeeey!  ...Your fairy partner who
hovers around self-explanatory objects and makes an annoying fuss. Whines
in English in every version. Hated across the land and beyond the seas.
MP +2 HP/DEF/SPD +166% MND +422% EVA +24 SPI +100 SIL +72

Fanelia
A powerful weapon described in ancient tomes from the era of the gods. Has
different stats across games, but it's generally a very strong 1-use item,
especially in Episode 1 where it turned the final battle into dead rubber.
MAG +524% HP/MND +128% DRK +100

Muramasa Blade!
Unquestionably the strongest weapon, far ahead of the others, but now that
its strength is so famous, its drop rate has been reduced or even removed
entirely in recent versions. Still the top or near the top when it appears.
ATK +599% MYS/DRK/PHY +56

Tera Bomb
Use it to deal incredible amounts of AOE damage. Emphasis on AOE. Using it
just because you made one and seeing your own party die too is like a rite
of passage. Give it the Narrow Range trait to make it simply a strong item.
MAG +344% ATK/SPD +222% FIR +128 SHK +40

WH04HL-KRSW
A laser rifle which overwhelms with its powerful yet voiceless cries. Its
stats change with each game, but it's usually a strong secret weapon that
bzzt-bzzt-bzzt-boom-boom-boom's you towards 100% parts completion.
All Stats +240%

Crimson Lotus Princess
The pitiable endgame "* Longsword" that players treat as the booby prize
while hoping for Ringil. Despite that, 4d5 damage, Chaos and Evil Slayer,
Sharpness, and Bloodsuck makes it top-tier for 1v1s against named demons.
HP/ATK +412% MAG/SPD +199% FIR +144 DRK +72 PAR/TRR/DTH +40

Blue Crystal Rod
A staff symbolizing peace for the kingdom. Also called the Pride of God.
Nowadays, more people know about it from a reference than its own series.
Not as great in GBC, where it has many equals and even betters.
MP +2 MAG +400% HP/DEF/MND +200% CLD +100 PAR/HVY +25

Prism Specs
The strongest accessory, giving +50% damage to physical and magic attacks.
...Though the effect doesn't show up in the status screen. Many grade
schoolers probably went for other accessories because of this discrepancy.
ATK/MAG +428%

Type-99 Fortified Suit
A super-skintight pilot suit. The Japan Empire put these to official use
in 1999. The trainee one even has things stuck in weird spots and can turn
invisible, reminding you after several hours that this is an 18+ VN.
TP +3 HP/DEF/MND +300% SHK/TRR/SIL +30

Gran Grimoire
A "grimoire" with the power to change the world. The magic to change St.
Ivalice into a parallel world, as well as the whole of the Magic Capital
Lea Monde is hidden within. Said to be a myth - but one worth dying for.
MP +4 MAG +600% MND +360% All Affinities +48

Necronomicon
A forbidden grimoire holding knowledge from the ancients. Reading it might
throw your sanity points out the window, or saddle you with a 1000-year-old
proud loli, or do other crazy things. Not good for your mental health.
TP +6 HP +360% MAG/MND +480% All Ailments +24

Chaos the Darksword
A demonic sword with a potty mouth that can nullify the Invincibility Field
that Fiends and the Archfiend possess. Formerly a perverted thief. A must
for fighting the demon army, but its owner barely gives a damn about it.
ATK +1680% ACC +32

Fundoshi Dimension Coupler
A fundoshi with power accrued from "Antimatter Worlds" from all parallel
dimensions, given form via the potential of all of their living beings. Why
it's in a fundoshi shape is unknown. At least it's not a female skeleton.
MP/TP +8 MAG/MND/SPD +720%

King's Reason
The Reason held by the Demi-Fiend with the King race title, feared as the
the hardest boss in RPG history. Pity the poor heroes constantly dying to
him. In fact, they're probably asleep and out of MP against him right now.
HP +880% ATK/MAG/DEF +560% DRK +240 DBF +100

Parallel Dimension Truth
A lump of mystery power dropped by the mystery meat triplets in postgame.
Once imbibed, it grants mysterious power upon the owner. However, if you
want to give it to another, you'd have to wait for it be puked out. Horror!
HP +640% ATK +480% DEF +880% MND +400% ACC +39 SHK/DTH/TRR +80

Flower Blade Kikuryusei
A self-regenerating vibroblade made under orders from the Kyomei emperor
to fight the Planeriums. Contains lots of hidden tech. The 27 manufactured
blades were mostly held by Scenario 11 participants. Now, only 3 remain.
HP/ATK/DEF/MAG +368% SPD+256% PHY +50 DTH +50

Ame-no-Habakiri
One of Japan's three legendary swords, used to slay the Yamata-no-Orochi.
Also known as Worochi-no-Aramasa or Futsushimitama-no-Tsurugi.
 
All Stats +400%

Winner's Rags
The tattered clothing worn by strange people as they train in the depths of
the dungeon. Emits a distinctly abnormal aura of sorts. It's hard to tell
if it's supposed to be worn as a cloak or as normal clothes.
HP/ATK +720% DEF/SPD +540% ACC/EVA +16 PSN/PAR/HVY/SHK +32

Regalia
Amongst the top-tier accessories forgable with orichalcum and adamantite,
this one stands out as the best of all. Effects vary with the game, but it
generally decreases all damage drastically. Even making one is a pain.
HP +600% All Affinities +172

Slayer Robe
Armor gotten by defeating that original guy somehow in a hopeless boss fight.
Only (sometimes) winnable by abusing Ether Doublers and raising stats
as high as they can go. Fortunately, it's not the best armor in the game.
ATK/SPD +377% ACC/EVA +24 DRK/PHY +80 TRR +64

Codex of Ultimate Wisdom
Incorporates all existing knowledge. 4's Avatar drew it from the Underworld
and caused its collapse. The game often makes you wonder if what you do is
really okay, and it usually isn't. In this case, you pay for it in 6.
DEF +400% MAG +240% MND +560% WND/MYS/SPI +88

Power Dragon Scalemail
The ultimate armor made from the scales of powerful and ancient
dragons who could crush stars and can murder the final boss as pets.

MYS/SPI/DRK/PHY +40

Machine God Lucifer
A techno-organic magical armor created by the Twelve Wise Men of Europa
as a counter against the Augoeides of angels and devils. Often referred to
as "Dragon Knight." A last resort only usable by people with dragon affinity.
All Stats +666% MYS/SPI/DRK/PHY +66

Scourge 
A sword wielded in the name of punishment. Brings calamity to its foes.
Has a high chance of draining 16 levels, inflicting petrify, confusion,
paralysis, dizzy, or death, but it mostly just overkills via pure damage.
ATK +800% DEF +400% PHY +100

Potion of Life
The ultimate HP healing medicine. Heals all stat downs and status effects.
It also heals 5000 HP, but even at max level, HP is not likely to exceed
1500 or so, and status are usually resisted anyways. Surprisingly useless.
HP +1280% PSN/PAR/SIL/DTH +128

Platinum Yendorian Card
A tourist-only artifact. Increases all stats and speed, gives slayer
effects, and +25 to AC. Also charges valuable staves and wands with nearly
no risk of breaking. Can make tourists even stronger at range than mages.
MP/TP +4 HP/ATK/DEF/MAG/SPD +299% MND +600% EVA +20

BFG9000
A weapon that shoots explosive green plasma with a wide AOE. Takes down
swarms of enemies well. The plasma is not the only damaging part, so skill
is needed for minmaxing. Its full name, "Big Fucking Gun," is awesome too.
ATK/MAG/SPD +480% FIR +120

Ringil
Strongest weapon for fighters on par with Vorpal. A legendary sword wielded
by High King Fingolfin to inflict seven unhealable wounds and render the
Dark Lord lame for eternity. Wonderful attack power and gives +10 to speed.
MP +4 ATK +360% MND/SPD +560% ACC +32 CLD/MYS +100

Tupsimati
The ruler's staff, shaped like a horn. Also called the Tablet of Destinies,
it allows control of fate itself. The few holders of this ultra-rare item
will defend against all calamities. May make your smiles more wonderful.
MP +6, HP/DEF/MND +300% MAG +800% MYS/SPI/DRK +99

Majestic Crown of Chaos
The iron crown atop the head of the Serpent of Chaos, who brings ruin to
the entire world. Does have great stats, but anti-teleport and eternal
curse makes it pretty much a sad bragging rights reward for all roles.
HP/DEF +1080% ATK/MAG +400% ACC +66 DRK +300 DTH +150

Jewel of Judgement
The eye of the Serpent of Chaos, torn from it during a deathly duel with
the Unicorn of Order. A magic item with untold power, but only usable by
masters of The Pattern, which has claimed many adept dimension travelers.
MP +8 HP +999% MAG +1440% TRR/SIL/DTH/DBF +50

Underworld Hammer "Grond" 
The great warhammer wielded by the being known as the "Dark Lord." Boasts
astounding damage and enchantment, slays Evil and *slays* Dragons, but its
massive weight makes it hard to use. Yep, another bragging rights reward.
TP +8 HP +999% ATK +999% PSN/PAR/HVY/SHK +50

"The One Ring"
Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords
in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die. Within all the
Rings of Power, this is the One Ring to rule them all.
HP/DEF/MND +999% EVA +40 CLD/WND/NTR +144

Liquid Metal Mind
An item that allows access to everyone's most desired class, the Liquid
Metal Slime. So strong that you won't even care about how it works. Resists
everything and learns the strongest magic and skills. Utterly broken.
DEF/MND +640% All Affinities +100 All Resistances +48

Will of Gensokyo
A power that you get for failing and failing until you finally beat up all
the fakers. It feels insulting for some fakers' drop to be called "Will of
Gensokyo", but the power is the real thing. Useful in all situations.
TP +8 All Stats +500% ACC/EVA +16 All Resist +32 HP Recovery +2 MP Recovery +1

True Ame-no-Murakumo
True Divine Sword that became stronger from absorbing vengeful spirits
underground. Now both its grip and whiskers have improved... or so it thinks.
According to Satori, at least.
All Stats +999%

Dragon God's Power Source
The origin of the power of the true Dragon God, who travels thousands of
worlds and created Gensokyo as we know it today. ...Well, a fragment of the
power anyway. It's still ridiculously strong, so equip it with gratitude.
All Stats +600% All Affinities +100 All Resistances +50

Fragment of Refined Metal
Smelt 2 weapons of the same class to get a scrap metal; combine 3 scrap
metals to get reclaimed metal. Combine 3 of those and you get this. You
need 3-4 of this to make headgear, though they don't give any bonuses.
Even so, if you want a hat, the quickest way is to just fork over some cash.

Fragment of Double Steel
A metal that is effective at refining weapons, armors and accessories.
When you use Double Steel, the material used immediately before will have
its effects increased twofold. Handy, but also rare.
 

Piece of Alexandrite
Ore involved in the quest to obtain a Mythic Weapon. 50,000 were needed,
and since they were usually divided among the party, it was known as the
"Alexandrite Life Imprisonment" trial. Later updates made them easier to
get, such that hardcore gamers now "only" take a year to get a Mythic.

Fragment of Mithril
Mithril means "grey glitter" in Sindarin. It shines like silver,
but it never tarnishes. It's found in the dwarven mines of Moria.
It was common during the Third Age, but due to dwarves' over-mining,
they awakened the "Durin's Bane," and Moria was annihilated with it.

Fragment of Scarlet Gold
The metal either just has a scarlet aura, or maybe shines with the light of
the sun, the records aren't very consistent on it. Anything that was made
out of scarlet gold completely disappeared by about World War II.
One of Marisa's Hakkero's materials. Probably also the Kusanagi's, too.

Evil Spirit's Soul
A mysterious object that shines with light, born when an evil spirit is
sealed. Since whether a soul is evil or not is completely subjectively
judged by Reimu and co., a lot of innocent souls wrongly get sealed up.
 

Fairy's Soul
Occasionally fly out of a fairy's mouth when you strike one at the back of
their head. The fairy doesn't die after, but generally runs instead, so
it's likely not a soul. In other games, "Fairy's etc" tend to be midgame
equips that increase agility and such, making Touhou's fairies a bit odd.

Fighter's Soul
As a fighter ends a fight, scare them from behind as they pause for breath
and this may come out. They don't die, so it's likely not their real soul.
 
 

Hero's Soul
Strange white fuzzies that drop from heroes, by kicking them from behind
after they've saved the world. Rare, since you have to find a hero first.
 
 

Shining Dragon's Soul
Souls from the strongest of Dragons, the strongest of species in Gensokyo.
When a strong Dragon yawns in the morning, these precious things come out.
So they're not souls after all. Wonder what they are.

Chunks filled with the enmity and power of even stronger enemies.
Place it in the middle of the room, and it will glow beautifully.
 
 

Azure Light
Chunks of enmity from extremely strong enemies that shines azure.
It's as bright as daylight even during the night.
A good light source that doesn't use up fuel.

Since it looks so charmingly shiny,
you can definitely make good equipment from them.
 

Strong Rugged Horns

really are supposed to look so sinister.
Often found on animal pack leaders.
 

Hard Husk
Some husk that's rather hard.

Strange Mechanical Part
Some mechanical parts with all sorts of complicated shapes.
Maybe you'll make the kappa happy by collecting a lot of them.
 
 

Great Tree Thread
Thread harvested from insects that live in the Great Tree.
Normal spider threads are already more durable than iron of same weight,
but these are even stronger. Maybe it's a result of the Great Tree's powers.
According to Yamame, this will eventually be mass produced.

Beautiful Crystal Piece
It's a piece of beautiful, but not exactly rare granite crystal.
Aside from being used in accessories, it's also piezoelectric.
So perhaps it can be used for that effect as well.
 

Colorful Rainbow Flower
A flower that blooms with seven colors, unseen in either Gensokyo or the
outside world. Apparently it has ultraviolet colors on it too, though we
can't see it either way. Wriggle might be able to though.
 

Sea of Trees' Fish's Fin
Fins from fishes that "swims" in the sea of trees. No one knows why they're
there though. Perhaps swimming there makes their fins grow larger.
 
 

Glittering Jewel
A mysterious jewel that distorts the air around it like a mirage. It's
breathtakingly beautiful, but staring at it is probably bad for your eyes.
 
 

Stone of Power
An unknown stone that radiates heat when you hold it tightly.
Tends to be held by strong enemies, so it must be strong itself.
Or at least, that's the lame reason Marisa gives for hoarding these.
 

Fine Metal Piece
A whole bunch of weirdly-shaped metal pieces.
Handy for making small accessories.
 
 

Viscous Liquid
If you ask what kind of things can this be used for, it apparently can
used in place of any kind of lubricant or glue. It's unexpectedly handy,
or so the kappa folks say.
 

Mysterious Structure
A mysterious structure composed of mysterious materials with a mysterious
shape. These things that no one can explain really tickles Marisa's fancy.
 
 

Curse-Whispering Shell
A cursed shell from which you can hear the sound of curses when placed
against your ear. Amongst curse maniacs, the curses you hear apparently
may be good or bad. It's a really strange world out there.
 

Light Needle
A needle that might be made with the light of the sun. Details are unknown.
It shines brightly so it's very hard to sew things with it. If you
collect 100 of them, you might be able to use them as an always-lit lamp.
 

Shining Black Stone
"Shining Black," an extremely odd stone.
It gives a very trompe-l'oeil feeling when looked at.
Rinnosuke says that there's some sort of dark power involved somehow.
 

Bottle of Hyperspace
A sealed-up bottle that contains hyperspace air, dropped by a monster that
originated from hyperspace. Apparently shouldn't be opened, lest the air
inside escapes to the atmosphere outside. How very suspicious.
 

Angel Wing
A brilliant feather that looks like it came from an angel,
but it actually was from some holy-looking monsters.
It's a rather blasphemous action, but Reimu and co. don't care.
 

Dull Light Water
Mysterious water that emits a dull, blue light.
Not much is known about it, but it's very heavy.
 
 

Spirit's Orb
A brilliant piece of crystal used in magic rituals. Marisa really wants
them, so don't take your eyes off the party's stock of them.
 
 

Ancient Fragment
A mysterious item that looks like some sort of rusted metal. It's not
certain whether this is really metal, but at least it feels ancient.

now, many kinds of different things may have burned to make them.
 
 

Blazing Igneous Rock
An igneous rock that still holds some heat.
Might be handy as a body warmer.
 
 

Hard-To-Melt Ice
A piece of ice that, for some reason, is harder to melt than normal.
Well, at least it doesn't melt easily when placed openly,
but human touch seems to melt it instantly.
 

Eternal Ice
A piece of ice that, for some reason, doesn't melt no matter what.
At least, it never melts when placed openly, but human touch
seems to melt it instantly. Kind of awesome, except it's kind of not.
 

Wind Sand
Sand that seems to summon wind when you throw it in the air. Can be handy
when you want to cool off, but then you'd get sand on your body and hair.
 
 

Stormy Selenite
A piece of stone that seems to be able to summon wind when held strongly.
Resists with wind when you try to break it with a hammer. How annoying.
 
 

Nature Fragment
Apparently a fragment of nature somehow, though details are unclear.
Maybe it's formed from solidified tree sap.
 
 

Shining Sprout
A sprout that's very shiny.
Commonly appreciated as a good luck symbol.

Tiny crystal balls used by unsavory priests.
When used in an unsavory manner, it can contain unsavory magic power.
 
 

Slightly Purifying Salt
Purifying salt that can be seen in the Great Tree. Youkai or humans from
outside may have placed them, or perhaps there are faithful monsters
inside. Reimu and co. took them without a thought though. How faithless.
 

Purifying Amulet
A holy amulet with the prayer of exorcism depicted on it.
It glitters with a faint light. and looks quite effective.
 
 

Black Sticky Paste
It's some sticky thing with evil power, or so Rinnosuke says.
It might go well with some sort of dark weapon. Sticky.
 
 

Cursed Straw Doll
A straw doll used by someone to curse someone else.
It's covered with negative human emotions.
 
 

Thorny Seed
Perhaps this is some kind of plant seed, but it's really quite big and
very spiky. In fact, it's spiky enough that it could probably kill some
unsuspecting plumber that stepped on it.
 

Rugged Seed
Rinnosuke identified this as a seed, but no matter how you look at it,
it looks more like a rock than a seed. It's so big and hard that you
can probably kill someone by throwing it at them.
 

Hemp Amulet
Amulet that was forcibly taken from a defeated enemy. It may not seem like
it's worth taking, but it is the adventurer's creed to take everything
that's not nailed down or on fire.

It has a very stylish pattern.

out. Might be cursed.

taken while the previous owner was knocked out. Poor thing.
 
 

Great Tree's Leaf
A leaf that's beautiful even amongst all the leaves from the Great Tree
that suddenly appeared. Since it's grown on this rather mysterious Great
Tree, it might contain mysterious powers within too.

capturing wind, as it needs to keep a large body afloat.
 
 

Magic Bird's Crest
A piece of feather found on the head of a magic bird, larger than any other
feather on its body. Used for intimidation, wooing the opposite sex, but
mostly as an appeal for its existence. Thus, they are often quite colorful.

Insect's exoskeleton that's somewhat hard.
The fur that grows along the surface is kind of disgusting.

and very light, and gives a colorful shine when exposed to sunlight.

They're leptoid scales, composed of only enamel and collagen,
so even if they're eaten by accident, the mouth can safely handle them.

Extremely hard, and far thicker and larger than modern fish scales.

out of unidentified metal. It's really hard, so refining it is difficult.

Oni's panties, apparently of good quality, and made from tiger skin. Those
who want to steal them lose interest as the oni don't really care.
 
 

Oni's Long Horn
The horn of an oni, as it says on the tin.
For Reimu and co. who'd steal the symbol and identify of an oni like that,
they're rather like oni themselves.

want, but it's an easy material to use for making into strings or a whips.

Makes for a heroic-looking decoration.

defined as a magnet at some point.

Damascus Steel
Metal made from wootz steel imported from India. Named after the Syrian

successful due to differences in materials and manufacturing techniques.

uniting themselves into one - a reflection of the progress of Reimu's own

Philosopher's Stone, or it being able to transform anything into gold.

Ultra Alloy M
A premier alloy sealed within Morita Capsules. Bring this to the laboratory
to allow creation of the best armor for everyone except the main character.
Having said that, they don't increase defense by all that much and have no
resists, so the Gaia Armor set you can buy from stores is actually better.

Hippocampus Herbal Tonic
An item that brings your dragon back to life. Harder to obtain than a
Phoenix Down, but not quite as rare as a Yggdrasil Leaf. The name is
probably a mix of traditional Chinese medicine and a fictional tonic, but
given how it's displayed in the game, it's pretty hard to tell.

Metacinnabar
A substance believed by the ancient Chinese to cure sicknesses and grant
longevity. Known as "Red" in Japan, and mercury sulfide in modern science.
Appears in texts everywhere as it produces alchemy's favorite element,
mercury, when heated. Red in its base form, but both red and black are HgS.

upper floors due to Heaven, the Dragon God, et al. Not particularly hard or
